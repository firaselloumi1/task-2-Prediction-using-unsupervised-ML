# Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
This project demonstrates K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset, utilizing unsupervised machine learning to identify patterns in data🔍.
## Technologies Used ⚙️:
- Python Libraries:
  -  🐼 Pandas, 🔢 NumPy (Data manipulation)  
  -  📊 Matplotlib,  Seaborn (Visualization)  
  -  🤖 Scikit-learn (Clustering)  

## Project Workflow 📋
- Data Preprocessing: Loaded and explored the Iris dataset. Dropped the Species column for clustering, and checked for missing values.  
- Optimal Clusters: Used the Elbow Method to determine k=3 clusters. 📐  
- K-Means Clustering: Applied K-Means and predicted clusters.  
- Visualization: Created scatter plots for feature pairs and visualized the cluster centroids. 📍

## Key Visuals 🖼️
- Heatmap: Correlation of features. 🔥
- Elbow Plot: Determined optimal k=3. 📈
- Cluster Plots: Displayed clusters and centroids for sepal and petal features

## Conclusion:
The project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can cluster the Iris dataset into 3 groups. This serves as a foundation for further exploration in machine learning. 💡
